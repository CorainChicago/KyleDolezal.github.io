  <h1>Learning Strategies for an Intensive Learning Environment</h1>

  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      When studying in an intensive learning environment, a student’s learning style and mindset are key considerations; the ability to harness one’s learning style and the right mindset can be the difference between success and failure.

    </p>
    <p>
Why are these fluffy-sounding concepts worth reading about? Why not focus on discipline and hard work rather than airy concepts like learning styles and mindset? There is extensive research demonstrating that there are ways to increase one’s learning potential by “working smart”, by harnessing one’s learning style and having the right mindset.

    </p>
    <p>
What does it mean to use one’s learning style as effectively as possible and to adopt a growth mindset? A brief overview of these concepts make the ideas clearer. Anthony Gregorc’s research has demonstrated that learning styles can be grouped using two axes: concrete versus abstract, and sequential versus random. In short, concrete thinkers focus on immediately-observable information using their five senses. Abstract thinkers are able to use intuition and visualization to conceive of ideas and concepts. Sequential thinkers think in a logical order, and random thinkers are able to think of concepts “out-of-order”, skipping steps and using intuition to formulate answers.
    </p>
<p>
Research on mindset focuses on fixed versus growth thinking. At the heart of the differences between a Fixed Mindset-thinker and a Growth Mindset-thinker is an opposite belief about one’s abilities. An individual with a Fixed Mindset believes intelligence, personality traits, and capacity for success are fixed. In contrast, someone with a Growth Mindset believes one’s abilities and traits have the ability to change or grow. A few every day examples can illustrate the difference. The concept of intelligence quotient seems aligned with the Fixed Mindset, as intelligence is quantified as a fixed amount for life. The ideas of “Practice makes perfect” and “You can do what you set your mind to” seem compatible with a Growth Mindset, which believes that abilities can grow over time.

</p>
<p>
  What does it look like when a student puts these ideas into action? A personal example illustrates the idea of using learning styles and a growth mindset to learn effectively. When learning, I am very comfortable reading and writing about theories and ideas related to my topic of study. When learning, I have a strong preference for reading and writing. My thinking style is abstract sequential. As a result, I learn particularly well through reading or writing about ideas.

  </p>
  <p>
    Some examples illustrate my strength for reading and writing about theories. I excelled academically in undergraduate and graduate programs that focused on reading and writing about social science theories. My personal learning efforts also centered on reading about programming and object-oriented theory and ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can apply my knowledge about my learning and thinking preferences by taking advantage of reading and writing opportunities as much as possible and by focusing on theory as much as possible. When I have learning opportunities that are more difficult for me I will give myself more time to take advantage to them, asking for clarification or help when necessary.

  </p>
  <p>
    When relying on this strategy, I will focus on getting better rather than getting good. I will adopt a Growth Mindset, viewing my skills, abilities, and intelligence as malleable and capable of growth. This includes having grit, viewing failures as opportunities to improve, and trying again rather than giving up.
  </p>
  <p>
    These strategies, according to the latest research on learning, can help me vastly expand my potential to succeed at Dev Bootcamp and beyond. Therefore, small differences in the way one approaches learning can make a huge difference in learning outcomes, particularly in an intensive learning environment such as Dev Bootcamp.
