  <h1>Restaurant versus Kitchen</h1>

      Is education like a restaurant or like a kitchen? In discussions about Dev Bootcamp, the "restaurant" model is described as one where education is a commodity to be purchased by students and dispensed by teachers. In contrast, the kitchen model is described as one wherein students participate in their own education and co-create things with more experienced cooks, their teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based upon my experience in the training and education fields, I hope the Dev Bootcamp experience is as much a "kitchen" experience as possible while remaining a "restaurant" experience as much as necessary.
    </p>

        In my experience in the education and training field, students learn best and learn most when they take an active role in their own education. As part of my work evaluating a new training program for adult learners, I tracked the progress of students who received various types of training. Those who performed best were those who received training that required critical thinking and planning on the part of students. Later, when working as a teacher, I observed similar traits among my students. For this reason, I hope Dev Bootcamp follows this model as much as possible.

       While I have a strong personal preference for this type of education, I have also learned that the kitchen model is an ideal, not always a reality. My experience as an educator has taught me that it is not always possible for students to be active in planning or creating their own learning experiences, particularly when they are just beginning to learn something or are learning something very quickly. In some instances, a great deal of direction and knowledge transfer from teachers is necessary. I expect that Dev Bootcamp will follow a restaurant model only as much as is necessary.

       If Dev Bootcamp is to prepare students for the workforce in a matter of a few months, it must quickly teach them a wealth of knowledge and must also encourage them to problem-solve on their own, at least as much as is necessary for workplace coding problems. It therefore seems to me that some elements of the kitchen model and the restaurant model will be necessary. As much as possible, I will try to have a "kitchen" experience at Dev Bootcamp.
