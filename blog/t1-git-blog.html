  <h1>Why Version Control? - A Personal Perspective</h1>

    <p>
      Version control is not what comes to mind when many people think of web development, but a personal perspective on version control illustrates its importance and advantages for coding projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control is the conscious, active effort to track and manage versions of a project or projects. To begin to understand version control, imagine a lack of version control. An individual or a group may make progress on a project but fail to keep copies of those parts of the project that have been completed successfully. Versions of a project may be updated and saved as "version 1", version 2", etc. as a project progresses, but there may be no conscious effort to separate versions on the basis of a single task being successfully completed, or there may be no knowledge about what new accomplishment corresponds to which version of a file.
    </p>
    <p>
        A project that uses version control is the opposite of the problematic scenario described above. With version control, there is an active effort to perform one task at a time, adding succesful improvements to already successful elements of a project. The contributors and their contributions can be tracked. Git is an example of version control, as it allows users to create branches of a main project. New work can be performed on branches and merged back into a main branch when new features are working correctly.
    </p>
<p>
        GitHub also allows for version control, as new tasks occur in new branches and are merged into a main branch only when the tasks have been successfully completed. GitHub has the added benefit of facilitating collaboration among developers, as multiple developers can contribute to a given project on GitHub without stepping on one-another's toes.
    </p>
<p>

Benefits of version control include the ability to make progress without the risk of negatively affecting past achievements. New code is necessary for progress to occur, but when added to a project is has the danger of breaking already-working code. Version control reduces this risk, as features are likely to be working before they are contributed to a main project, and as problematic versions of a project can be discarded in favor of previous, working versions. Version control therefore also facilitates collaboration, as developers can work simultaneously on different aspects of a single project without interfering with each other's code. Throughout collaborative projects, an organisation can track the progress of the overall project and of each contribution to the project.

It is ultimately individuals who rely upon version control, so a personal perspective helps illustrate the value of the practice. In my professional experience, version control is an invaluable tool in public service settings. Many of the concepts that apply to multifaceted coding projects also apply to projects involving government documents, particularly those requiring multiple revisions. In those cases, principles of version control are applied. Similarly, principles of version control are applied to texts as they are being prepared for publication, particularly those with multiple contributors. Finally, version control is an ideal practice in a development bootcamp setting, as those who learn to thrive in a version control-oriented environment are well-equipped to succeed in tech industry jobs.
