  <h1>Dealing with Collections of Ruby Objects: Arrays versus Hashes</h1>
  <h2>Are you a hoarder or a collector?</h2>
  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      What is the difference between a hoarder and a “collector”? The difference is that a collector organizes his or her objects into a collection, whereas a hoarder just amasses a motley assortment of objects, keeping them in a state of disarray.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ruby offers collections to allow one to be a collector rather than a hoarder. With collections, one can order data in terms of a logical organizational structure rather than a mess of unrelated variables. Rather than:

    </p>
    <p>
      <section class="code">
        <p>student_id = 20143</p>
        <p>student_ age = 20</p>
        <p>student_major = “Economics”</p>
        <p>student_status = “full-time”</p>
      </section>
    </p>


    <p> we can write:</p>
      <section class="code">
      student_20143 = {student_id: 20143, student_age: 20, student_major: "Economics", student_status: “full-time”}</section>
<p> The student’s data is now stored in a single collection rather than a group of unrelated variables.
</p>
  <p>Two popular types of collections in Ruby are arrays and hashes. Arrays collect lists of data organized by numerical index. For example, a one-dimensional array stores a student’s test scores over the course of a class:</p>
    <section class ="code">
      scores = [98, 100, 88, 78, 100]
    </section>
<p>The scores can be accessed using their respective index numbers, starting with zero. For example,
</p><p>
<section class = "code">scores[2] = 88.
  </section></p>
<p>A two-dimensional array could store a student number and each student’s scores throughout the course. For example,
</p>
<p>
<section class = "code">scores = [[20143, 98, 99, 88], [30211, 88, 97, 88], [23022, 88, 97, 99]] </section></p>
<p>Therefore, a single collection can store data for each student’s test scores and student IDs.
</p>
<p>Hashes also collect data, but they allow data to be accessed via keys rather than numerical indexes. In the earlier example, a hash is initialized with values for a student age, student major, and student status. To access the data via keys, one can type </p>
<p>
  <section class = "code">student_20143[student_age].</section>
  </p>
<p>Which collection type is best for which situation? While there is no universal rule, some examples demonstrate that arrays and hashes tend to lend themselves to different types of situations. Consider a list of product weights. In arrays, we can store and access the weights like this:
</p>
<p>
  <section class = "code">
weights = [10, 12, 18, 11, 9, 10].
</section> </p>
<p>However, with hashes, we should create a key for each value:
</p>
<p> <section class = "code">weights = {product1: 10, product2: 12, product3: 18, product4: 11, product5: 9, product6: 10}.
</section></p>
<p>In this case, arrays are less tedious.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, consider a dictionary of computer terms: For hashes, we can write:
</p>
<p>
<section class="code">collections = {“array”: “A collection organized by numerical index”, “hash”: “a collection organized by keys”, “sets”: “A collection of related objects all belonging</p><p> to the same logical set.”}
</section>
</p>
<p>However, for arrays, we must either organize the word and definition by numerical index, or we must have two values for each index, one being a word and another being a definition. Therefore, in this case, hashes lend themselves particularly well to the task at hand.
</p>
<p>

Ruby therefore offers us many opportunities to be collectors rather than hoarders. Among the options are arrays and hashes. Depending on the kind of objects being stored and accessed, one or the other may be particularly useful for organizing data.
