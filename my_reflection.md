# 8. Creating your website Reflection

My Wireframe URL:

My Website url: http://kyledolezal.github.io

#### I spent [8] hours on this challenge.

Discuss the following:
- What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
- What would you like to add or change about the site next?
- Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
- Create a TODO list of features you want to add in the future.
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The process involved initial research about HTML and CSS and wireframing. Following this initial work, I did a great deal of trial and error to get the results I wanted. The process ultimately worked, but it was very time-intensive.

I would like to keep my site simple, clean, and professional. I would like to add a more finished, professional look to my site.

It was quite difficult to get the layout to work as planned. Other aspects of what I learned were easily-applied.

In the future I would like to have an "about me" page and a page showcasing my social media contacts.

I found some references for positioning objects using CSS. Chief among these references was http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp.
